# FastTrack

## Overview
- FastTrack is a crowd-sourcing iOS app enabling the real-time reporting and monitoring of location busyness on the Georgia Tech campus
- Built using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React Native, Node)
- Started during HackGT 9 by Georgia Tech students :)
  - Main Developer: Rishi Soni
  - UI Design: Long Lam
  - Developer: Thanh Trinh

## Usage
To run this application on a simulator, do the following steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have React Native installed (https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
3. Perform MongoDB admin authentication (admin access is restricted)
4. `npm install`
5. `bundle install`
6. `npx pod-install`

You can now use `npm run ios` to run the application!

## Contributing
Unfortunately, there is no great way of doing this currently since MongoDB admin access is restricted. However, feel free to email suggestions to Rishi (rsoni37@gatech.edu).
